						<h5>As far back as cave drawings, wolves have featured in human mythology. And it's been a love-hate relationship. There were fewer than 50 gray wolves left in the lower United States, most scientists say, as recently as a few decades ago. They had been hunted, trapped and poisoned to near extinction during the settling of the West.</h5>

"At this age, if it hasn't moved in three hours," Jimenez says, "it's probably dead." That's when he goes to find them.</h5>
